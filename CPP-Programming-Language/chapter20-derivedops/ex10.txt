This question is extremely vague. Text processing could include a lot of
things. I suppose these facilities would be handy:

- Regex matching using a variety of different options (line-by-line, global,
  case insensitivity, etc.) This could include regular expression substring
  matches (captures) to assist with extracting values from a parsed string.
- If we want to parse the text as if it were a delimited data file, it would
  be nice to have functions to split the text into rows and columns using a
  viariety of delimiters (either basic strings or regular expressions).
- Text parsing functions to output a stream of tokens, useful for parsing
  things like JSON, YAML, XML. The text processor could convert a basic string
  of characters into a token stream.
