// create a copy of the stack so that we don't need to change it
// then "reverse" that stack into yet another stack, and print out those values in order
// this method is still O(n) but has a higher per-element cost because of the multiple
// copies that need to be made. to make this faster, some implementations support the
// ability to get the underlying collection. however, any technique that relied on this
// would not be portable. so i'll do it the straightforward way here.
