// This is Duff's device. It "unrolls" a loop by performing 8 work items per iteration instead of one.
// The "remainder" of the count is handled by potentially starting in the middle of the loop on the first
// go (this is what the switch statement is for). Then the do/while loop takes over and performs the rest
// of the work, doing 8 copies at a time.
// Loop unrolling has speed benefits because executing sequential instructions that copy values is faster
// than doing many conditional jumps, which is what a loop does. This loop has to do up to 8 times fewer
// conditional jumps to perform the same work.
// Some compilers unroll loops automatically when feasible and when that optimization is enabled.
