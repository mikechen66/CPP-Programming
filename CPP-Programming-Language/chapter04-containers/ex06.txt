For GCC/G++, there is no documented limit for local or external variable
names, but specific platforms may impose a limit. Allowed characters are
consistent with the C++ standard, unless non-standard language extensions are
enabled.

For MSVC: Longest local variable name = 2048 significant chars, extra chars
ignored. The mangled (compiled) name cannot be longer than 2048.  Longest
external variable name = 2047 significant chars, extra chars ignored. Length
can be decreased via compiler flag.  No char restrictions beyond standard C++
restrictions.
