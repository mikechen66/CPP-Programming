On Ubuntu server (Precise) include files are installed under /usr/include. C++
standard include headers are under /usr/include/c++/4.6 (for GCC 4.6). Both
paths are included in the header search list. Standard headers reside in the
c++ folder, while C headers and non-standard headers reside anywhere under
/usr/include.

Example of standard headers:
/usr/include/c++/4.6/cstdlib (C++ version)
/usr/include/stdlib.h (C version)

Platform specific headers are in a folder named after the "platform triple",
e.g.:
/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/sys/time.h

Non-standard example:
/usr/include/libpng/png.h
