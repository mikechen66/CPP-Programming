In this example, the Storable class actually has a field called store.
However, since virtual inheritance is used, there is still only one base
class. Therefore, there is only one vtable:

Radio's layout looks like this:
    Pointer to vtable (Transmitter::Storable)
    Pointer to vtable (Receiver::Storable)
    const char* store

Radio's vtable would look like this:
    vtable: (Storable)
        Ptr to Radio::get_file()
        Ptr to Radio::read()
        Ptr to Radio::write()

The method of invoking the virtual function is much simpler.

1. Get the index for the Storable::read() function in the vtable.
2. Get the pointer located at that index in the vtable.
3. The pointer points to Radio::read(), so call it.
