The SetDefault function is a static member function of the Date class. It can be accessed in several ways:

First, it can be accessed directly using the namespace and class name:
Calendar::Date::SetDefault(2008, Calendar::Date::Month(1), 31);

Second, it can be accessed with the assistance of a using directive:
using namespace Calendar; --or-- using Calendar::Date;
Date::SetDefault(2008, Date::Month(1), 31);

Or it can be accessed from within the Date class; for example, it could
be called from within the Date class--either from a static function, or an instance
function. In this case, it can be called without any qualifying names:
SetDefault(2008, Month(1), 31);
