So, about what I suggested last night, I am not interested in opening a bar named "Bamboozles"... I am ECSTATIC!! I'm drafting my resignation letter immediately!

I'm reviewing this resignation notification from Connie Watt and I have a few questions about your notes on the matter. I prefer to ask them in person, could you please swing by my office before lunch?

Heeeeyyy.. Mom called and asked me when the last time I heard from you was. I tried calling you at home but your inbox is full. When you get this call me or page me at the hospital (404) 555-7277.

Consider this a final warning on losing your security deposit. It has been a week since you rented the Staples Room for your event and it is STILL a mess. To the point where the smell of whatever food is in there is becoming a problem for guests passing by in the hall! Your partner asked why I demand a $500 deposit for events? Its because I DON'T like cleaning up after clients.

You have until 3pm to get the hall cleaned at which point I will be calling in a crew and keeping your deposit. Call me if you have any concerns (404) 555-1326.

Maybe this is putting the cart before the horse but I've always had a strong feeling about what a "good" sign for a business should be. I've attached a few ideas I've had, please make some notes and return them to me.

Also, I was sketching these at the coffee shop and the waitress asked me if it was "Bamboozles" or "Bamboozle's". I kind of like the posessive version as it begs the question "Who is Bamboozle?". I dunno, what do you think.

Please get back to me soon on this or any of the other ideas I've sent you (work must really be tough this week! Just quit like I did, the extra pressure has been a boon for my productivity!)

Connie, I've arranged for you to meet with Mary in HR on Monday morning. We found a way to consider this past week a stress leave and your job is still yours IF you show up on Monday. There are some papers to sign and you may need to meet with Ed Smoot, he's with employee services and will explain more when you see him. If you see him.

Anyway, I know New Years is a reflective time and if you have always had a dream to open your own restaurant/bar/club/whatever I think that's great but in the waking world you have a solid job that pays the bills so its time to lay off the snooze button.

If nothing else will convince you please read into the fact that no one has heard from Des in a week and he's probably NOT searching for the right location for a new business. He's been unemployed for a few months and you shouldn't get caught up in his delusions.

This was a very interesting interview. I've attached my notes and recommendation, I'll leave it to you to corroborate the facts. I'll also be forwarding the details to my superior to determine what our legal obligations are.
