# Programming Principles and Practices Using C++ 
Chapter One Computers, People, and Programming

In this chapter, we present some of the things that we think make programming important, interesting, and fun. We also present a few fundamental ideas and ideals. We hope to debunk a couple of popular myths about programming and programmers. This is a chapter to skim for now and to return to later when you are struggling with some programming problem and wondering if itâ€™s all worth it.
