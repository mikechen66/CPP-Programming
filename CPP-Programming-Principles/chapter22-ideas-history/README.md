# Programming Principles and Practice Using C++
Chapter 22 Ideas and History

This chapter is a very brief and very selective history of programming languages and the ideals they have been de- signed to serve. The ideals and the languages that express them are the basis for professionalism. Because C++ is the language we use in this book, we focus on C++ and languages that influ- enced C++. The aim is to give a background and a perspective to the ideas presented in this book. For each language, we present its designer or designers: a language is not just an abstract cre- ation, but a concrete solution designed by individuals in response to problems they faced at the time.
