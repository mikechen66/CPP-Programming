# Programming Principles & Practice

## Chapter 16 - Graphical User Interfaces

I'm hitting a wall with all this graphics stuff. I see the benefit, I understand the purpose of the exercise, I just don't enjoy this. It feels like doing JavaScript and I can do JavaScript. My strong desire to learn more about memory management and the "meat" of C++ is pulling me forward.

I'll move on to Chapter 17 for the awesome stuff therein. Perhaps I will come back to this in the future.
