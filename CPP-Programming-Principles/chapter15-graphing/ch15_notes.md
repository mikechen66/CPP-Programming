# Programming Principles & Practice

## Chapter 15 - Graphing Functions & Data

1. A function of one argument... is a function with one argument. Not sure what we're going for here. Composable? A candidate for a lambda? Neither of those answers necessarily.
2. You might use a continuous line to represent data when all of its points are connected by other factors or if the data was cumulative. Discrete points would be used when tracking multiple incidences of something, each of which is independent of another.
3. A slope is defined by division/multiplication.
4. A parabola is a "U" shaped mirrored curve.
5. You can create an "x" or "y" axis by using the Axis shape.
6. A default argument is a value that, if not provided, defaults to a set value by the constructor. You might use them when offering extra customizable options.
7. Functions may be composed by calling them and adding the results or by passing the return value of one function as the argument to another.
8. You would color and label a graphed function the same way that you color and label other shapes.
9. A series of calculated points approximate the funciton that is used to generate them. They visualize the behaviour of the function.
10. Sketching a layout helps to solidify the vision and reveal any patterns for coding that may not be apparent upon imagining.
11. You scale your graph with the ratio between the data range and the axis range.
12. By using the above guidlines.
13. We format the input to help with debugging and comprehension.
14. You would plan the general layout by first considering what format the data would be best displayed in; as a line, bar, pie. Then sketch the graph as you'd like to see it, and define constants for the necessary values.
