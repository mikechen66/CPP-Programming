# Programming Principles and Practice Using C++

## Chapter 2 - Hello, World!

1. The "Hello, World!" program is our introduction to any new language. It puts the syntax on our lips and the process into our hands.
2. The four parts of a function are a return type, a name, a parameter list, and the function body.
3. Every C++ program must contain a main() function.
4. The return value of 0 indicates that the program has terminated successfully.
5. The compiler attempts to translate the C++ code into machine language.
6. The `#include` directive instructs the computer to make available the resources in the following file. Like a module?
7. The `.h` suffix at the end of a filename in C++ indicates a header file. A header file contains definitions such as `cout` that we can use.
8. The linker connects our compiled program with the standard C++ library to create an executable program.
9. A source file is our writted code, human readable. An object file is the compiled, computer readable output.
10. IDEs usually contain an editor, syntax highlighting and aids, compiling and debugging tools.
11. You gotta do it and do it. This isn't a textbook about how to read.
