# Standard Template Library
Alexander Stepanov and Meng Lee

## Introduction 

The Standard Template Library (STL) is a software library for the C++ language that influenced 
the C++ Standard Library. It provides four components called algorithms, containers, functions, 
and iterators.

## History 

The STL was created as the first library of generic algorithms and data structures for C++, with 
four ideas in mind: generic programming, abstractness without loss of efficiency, the Von Neumann 
computation model and value semantics.
