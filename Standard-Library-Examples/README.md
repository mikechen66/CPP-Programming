# The C++ Standard Library 2ED
Nicolai M. Josuttis

## Introduction

The C++ standard library provides a set of common classes and interfaces that extend the core C++ language. 
However, it is not self-explanatory. To make full use of its components and to benefit from their power,
developers need a resource to do the much more things than list the classes and related functions.

## Features

The material describes this library as now incorporated into the new ANSI/ISO C++ language standard (C++11). 
It provides comprehensive documentation of each library component, including an introduction to its purpose 
and design; clearly written explanations of complex concepts; the practical programming details needed for 
effective use; traps and pitfalls; the exact signature and definition of the most important classes and 
functions; and numerous examples of working code.

## Focus

The book focuses on the Standard Template Library (STL), examining containers, iterators, function objects, 
and STL algorithms. Developers will also find detailed coverage of strings, concurrency, random numbers and 
distributions, special containers, numerical classes, internationalization, and the IOStreams library. An 
insightful introduction to fundamental concepts and an overview of the library will help bring newcomers 
quickly up to speed. A comprehensive index will support the C++ programmer in his/her day-to-day life.

## Covering

Extending the overall content by about 50%, the book covers all the new C++11 library components as follows. 

Concurrency
Fractional arithmetic
Clocks and Timers
Random numbers and distributions
New smart pointers
Regular expressions
New STL containers, such as arrays, forward lists, and unordered containers
New STL algorithms
Tuples
Type traits and type utilities
