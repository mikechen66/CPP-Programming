# A Tour of C++
Bjarne Stroustrup

This book gives an overview of C++ as defined by C++17, the current ISO C++ standard, and implemented by the major C++ suppliers. In addition, it mentions concepts and modules, as defined in ISO Technical Specifications and in current use, but not scheduled for inclusion into the standard until C++20.
