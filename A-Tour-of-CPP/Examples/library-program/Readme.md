# The Example of Book Program

## Requirements for the book program

This exercise and the next few require you to design and implement a
Book class, such as you can imagine as part of software for a library. Class
Book should have members for the ISBN, title, author, and copyright
date. Also store data on whether or not the book is checked out. Create
functions for returning those data values. Create functions for checking
a book in and out. Do simple validation of data entered into a Book; for
example, accept ISBNs only of the form n-n-n-x where n is an integer and
x is a digit or a letter. Store an ISBN as a string.


## Applications

1. Add operators for the Book class. Have the == operator check whether
the ISBN numbers are the same for two books. Have != also compare
the ISBN numbers. Have a << print out the title, author, and ISBN on
separate lines.

7. Create an enumerated type for the Book class called Genre. Have the
types be fiction, nonfiction, periodical, biography, and children. Give
each book a Genre and make appropriate changes to the Book constructor
and member functions.

8. Create a Patron class for the library. The class will have a user’s name,
library card number, and library fees (if owed). Have functions that access
this data, as well as a function to set the fee of the user. Have a helper
function that returns a Boolean (bool) depending on whether or not the
user owes a fee.

9. Create a Library class. Include vectors of Books and Patrons. Include a
struct called Transaction. Have it include a Book, a Patron, and a Date
from the chapter. Make a vector of Transactions. Create functions to add
books to the library, add patrons to the library, and check out books.
Whenever a user checks out a book, have the library make sure that both
the user and the book are in the library. If they aren’t, report an error.
Then check to make sure that the user owes no fees. If the user does,
report an error. If not, create a Transaction, and place it in the vector of
Transactions. Also write a function that will return a vector that contains
the names of all Patrons who owe fees.
