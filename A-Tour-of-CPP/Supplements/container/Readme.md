# Supplements - Vector, Container and Algorithm

## Introduction

The C++ standard library provides a framework for dealing with data as sequences of elements, called the STL, designed by Alex Stepanov. The STL is the part of the ISO C++ standard library that provides containers (such as vector, list, and map) and generic algorithms (such as sort, find, and accumulate). The simplest definition of generic programming in C++ is â€œusing templates. Generic programming: Writing code that works with a variety of types presented as arguments, as long as those argument types meet specifi c syntactic andsemantic requirements. It is originally No.19 ~ No.21 Chapters, Porogramming Principles and Practice Using C++ 2nd Edition.

## Container

A container is a holder object that stores a collection of other objects (its elements). They are implemented as class templates, which allows a great flexibility in the types supported as elements. The container manages the storage space for its elements and provides member functions to access them, either directly or through iterators (reference objects with similar properties to pointers). The C++ containers include vector, list, deque, map, multimap, unordered_map, unordered_multimap, set, multiset, unordered_set, unordered_multiset and array.
