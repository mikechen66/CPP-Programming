Today we moved our 4 year old son out of his toddler bed to his own double bed in a separate room. We bought a double because we currently don't have an extra bed for company should someone need to sleep over due to weather or excessive drunken-ness. As of this moment, we have said our goodnights and are waiting to see if he falls asleep or sneaks out with another negotiation attempt. My wife started up a final load of laundry so I'm unable to hear what's happening in his room, if he's talking to himself, jumping on the bed, or, I fear, crying. It's not easy but he's a big boy now and he was nearly touching either end of his toddler bed as it was. Hopefully he's able to sleep the whole night but if not I am prepared to spend the night beside him should he arrive at our bedside full of sadness or fear.
