# Data structure with C++

## Introduction

It is an introductory book that describes data structures and algorithms, 
and strives to be concise, rigorous and easy to learn and master.

## Content

It begins with an introduction to the relationship between computational 
thinking and programming, and talks about the 4 parts of how to cultivate 
computational thinking: decomposition, pattern recognition, pattern 
generalization and abstraction and algorithms.

## Classical Algorithms

It elaborates the classification of classic algorithms: divide and conquer 
method, recursion method, dynamic programming method, iterative method, 
enumeration method, backtracking method and greedy method. It includes 
sorting algorithms, search algorithms, array and linked list algorithms, 
security algorithms, stack and queue algorithms, tree graph structures 
algorithms.
