#  C++ Programming

## Introduction 

C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language. It is simply called as C with Classes. The modern C++ has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle and IBM. 


## C++ Features

C++ is standardized by the ISO with the latest standard version ratified and published as ISO/IEC 14882:2020 (informally known as C++20). The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which was then amended by the C++03, C++11, C++14, and C++17 standards. The current C++20 standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library. Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension of the C language. Since 2012, C++ has been on a three-year release schedule with C++23 as the next planned standard.


## High Performance 

C++ was designed with an orientation toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found quite useful in the performance-critical fields of system application, database, GPU-enabled deep learning, graphics design, search engine, e-commerce, financial transaction and video games.
