## C++ Templates 
David Vandevoorde, Nicolai M. Josuttis, Douglas Gregor

The materials provide the information necessary to start using templates and benefit from their power,
as well as to provide information that will enable experienced programmers to push the limits of the
state-of-the-art. To achieve this, we decided to organize our text in parts:

Part I introduces the basic concepts underlying templates written in a tutorial style.

Part II presents the language details and is a handy reference to template-related constructs.

Part III explains fundamental design and coding techniques supported by C++ templates. They
range from near-trivial ideas to sophisticated idioms.
