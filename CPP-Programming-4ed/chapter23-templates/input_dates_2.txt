"Please state your name for the court, and your date of birth, in mm/dd/yyyy format."

"My name is Connie Watt, I was born 10/13/1981."

"Thank you, and what was your relationship to the victim?"

"Desmond was a very dear friend."

"Miss Watt, please tell the court where you were on the night of 12/31/2017."

Connie thought for a moment. Mr Schweiber had instructed her to take her time to think before each answer but this was not an exercise in calmness. It was 02/16/2018 today, a month and a half since that fateful New Years Eve. She knew where she WAS on that day but could not remember the name of the building..

Dammit.. what was it.. called again?

"The Staples Room in the Fairmont Hotel. In the evening."

She barely remembered saying the words. She knew but she didn't.

"And when did you meet Mr Carlin"

"A long time ago, but I can tell you the date, 11/15/2001, the date of the original XBOX launch."
