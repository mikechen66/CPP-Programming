I remember 2/5/1997 like it never happened
I remember 12/24/2008 like it was yesterday..
Tues Feb 27 2018 was my birthday again!
9Tues, May 5 2004 was ruined by a 9
It was the winter cold that wore me on December 16, 21050
Sometimes 30 26 36 1/2 is enough.
Thurs, Feb 27 1997 was a different time..
Once, on August 28, 1963, I had a dream.
