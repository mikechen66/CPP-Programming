# The C++ Programming Language
Bjarne Stroustrup

## Introduction

C++ is a general-purpose programming language emphasizing the design and use of type-rich,
lightweight abstractions. It is particularly suited for resource-constrained applications, 
such as those found in software infrastructures. C++ rewards the programmer who takes the 
time to master techniques for writing quality code.

## Target 

This book is aimed at three audiences: C++ programmers who want to know what the latest ISO 
C++ standard has to offer, C programmers who wonder what C++ provides beyond C, and People 
with a background in application languages, such as Java, C#, Python, and Ruby, looking for 
something "closer to the machine" â€“ something more flexible, something offering better compile
time checking, or something offering better performance.

## C++ Features

C++ is standardized with the latest standard version ratified and published as C++20. The 
previous version was amended by the standards of C++03, C++11, C++14, and C++17. The C++20 
standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library. Since 2012, 
C++ has been on a three-year release schedule with C++23 as the next planned standard.
